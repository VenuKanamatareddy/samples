# # Strands Agent with OpenInference and Arize Observability
# 
# ## Introduction
# 
# ### What are Strands Agents?
# [Strands Agents](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) is an open-source SDK  which is a simple-to-use, code-first framework for building agents. Strands provides a flexible framework for creating agents that can use tools, maintain context, and solve complex tasks . The SDK makes it easy to integrate with AWS services like Amazon Bedrock for LLMs and Amazon DynamoDB for persistence. 
# 
# Key features of Strands Agents in this example include:
# - Tool usage with built-in and custom tools
# - Built-in observability and telemetry
# - Integration with AWS services
# 
# ### What is Arize AI?
# [Arize AI](https://arize.com/) is an observability platform designed specifically for LLMs and AI systems. It helps teams monitor, troubleshoot, and improve their AI applications by providing insights into model performance, usage patterns, and potential issues. Arize supports the [OpenInference](https://openinference.ai/) standard, which is an open specification for LLM telemetry.
# 
# Key features of Arize AI include:
# - Real-time monitoring of LLM applications
# - Trace visualization and analysis
# - Performance metrics and analytics
# - Support for the OpenInference standard
# - Evaluation and feedback collection
# 
# ## Overview
# In the Strands Agents SDK, observability refers to the ability to measure system behavior and performance. All observability APIs are embedded directly within the Strands Agents SDK. This notebook demonstrates how to integrate Strands Agents with OpenInference and Arize AI for observability. OpenInference standardizes traces and spans data across models, frameworks, tool calls, prompts, retrievers, and more. By converting Strands telemetry to OpenInference format, we can leverage Arize AI's powerful visualization and monitoring capabilities. 
# 
# ![Architecture](images/architecture.png)
# 
# In this example, we'll build a restaurant assistant agent that helps customers with restaurant information and reservations. The agent will use various tools including knowledge base retrieval and booking management functions. We will use Strands to OpenInference Converter for Arize AI that provides a span processor that converts Strands telemetry data to OpenInference format for compatibility with Arize AI.
# 
# ## What You'll Learn
# - How to set up OpenInference with Arize AI for Strands Agents
# - How to use the custom `StrandsToOpenInferenceProcessor` to convert telemetry
# - How to build a functional restaurant assistant with Strands

# ## Setup and Prerequisites
# 
# Before running this notebook, ensure you have completed the following prerequisites:
# 
# ### Prerequisites
# * Python 3.10+
# * AWS account with appropriate permissions
# * Anthropic Claude 3.7 enabled on Amazon Bedrock
# * IAM role with permissions to create Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base, Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon DynamoDB
# * [Arize AI account](https://app.arize.com/signup) with API key and Space ID
# * Run `sh deploy_prereqs.sh` to set up the agent tools and knowledge base
# 
# ### Required Packages
# First, let's install the necessary packages for our integration:

# In[1]:


get_ipython().system('pip install -q -r  requirements.txt')


# In[ ]:


get_ipython().system('pip install --upgrade strands-agents strands-agents-tools ')


# Run `sh deploy_prereqs.sh` to set up the agent tools and knowledge base.
# Skip this step if you have the resources set up from 01-tutorials/01-fundamentals/08-observability-and-evaluation and haven't cleaned up the resources.

# In[ ]:


pip show strands-agents strands-agents-tools


# In[ ]:


get_ipython().system('sh deploy_prereqs.sh')


# ## Configuring Arize AI Integration
# 
# ### Setting up Arize AI Connection
# 
# To connect with Arize AI, we need to configure our API key, Space ID, and endpoint. These credentials allow us to send telemetry data to the Arize platform for visualization and analysis. You can obtain these credentials from your [Arize AI dashboard](https://app.arize.com/settings). Please add your API_KEY and SPACE_ID in the cell below.

# In[5]:


import os

#Set Arize Endpoint, API and Space ID keys as env variables
API_KEY = "ak-a3d15a8e-93f5-4f7d-b9d8-8d8ed2547cdc-dB_Ki8ZTW_UJ26KG1zYHGS0i9dL_kK5g"
SPACE_ID = "U3BhY2U6MjgyNTg6UkxMMQ=="
SESSION_ID = "session-abc-4" # <---We'll use this to group our trace conversations to simulate sessions

ENDPOINT = "otlp.arize.com:443"
os.environ["ARIZE_SPACE_ID"] = SPACE_ID
os.environ["ARIZE_API_KEY"] = API_KEY
os.environ["OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT"] = ENDPOINT


# ### Setting up OpenInference with Arize
# 
# Now we'll configure OpenTelemetry with our custom `StrandsToOpenInferenceProcessor`. This processor is responsible for converting Strands telemetry data to the [OpenInference format](https://openinference.ai/) that Arize AI can understand and visualize.
# 
# The processor handles:
# - Converting Strands span kinds to OpenInference span kinds (LLM, TOOL, AGENT, CHAIN)
# - Mapping Strands attributes to OpenInference attributes
# - Creating a hierarchical graph structure for visualization
# - Preserving important metadata like token usage and model information

# ## Building the Restaurant Assistant Agent
# 
# Now we'll create our Restaurant Assistant agent using Strands. This agent will help customers with restaurant information and reservations using several tools:
# 
# 1. `retrieve` - Searches the knowledge base for restaurant information
# 2. `current_time` - Gets the current time for reservation scheduling
# 3. `create_booking` - Creates a new restaurant reservation
# 4. `get_booking_details` - Retrieves details of an existing reservation
# 5. `delete_booking` - Cancels an existing reservation
# 
# The agent uses Amazon Bedrock's Claude 3.7 Sonnet model for natural language understanding and generation.

# ## Testing the Agent and Generating Traces
# 
# Let's test our agent with a couple of queries to generate traces for Arize. Each interaction will create spans in OpenTelemetry that will be processed by our custom processor and sent to Arize AI.
# 
# ### Test Case 1: Restaurant Information Query
# First, let's ask about restaurants in San Francisco. This will trigger the knowledge base retrieval tool.

# In[8]:


# Find restaurants in a locale
results = agent("Hi, where can I eat in Napa?")
print(results)


# ### Test Case 2: Restaurant Reservation
# Now, let's test the booking functionality by making a reservation. This will trigger the create_booking tool.

# In[ ]:

    model=model,
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    tools=[
        retrieve, current_time, get_booking_details,
        create_booking, delete_booking

            "Arize-Project",
            "OpenInference-Integration",
        ]
    }
)

# Make a reservation request
results = agent("Make a reservation for tonight at Ember and Vine. At 8pm, for 2 people in the name of Ricardo")
print(results)


# ### Test Case 3: Cancel reservation and Rebook 
# Now, let's cancel our reservation and make a new reservation at a different restaurant. This will trigger the delete_booking and create_booking tools.

# In[ ]:


agent = Agent(
    model=model,
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    tools=[
        retrieve, current_time, get_booking_details,

#Cancel booking and rebook at another restaurant
results = agent("I change my mind. Cancel my reservation at Ember and Vine with booking id c8118e24. Instead, book a reservation for Rice & Spice for party of 2 under Ricardo at 8pm tonight")
print(results)


# ### Test Case 4: Ask for movie recommendation (out of scope skill)
# Now, ask to suggest a movie purposely to see how the agent handles this question.

# In[ ]:


agent = Agent(
    model=model,
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    tools=[
        retrieve, current_time, get_booking_details,
        create_booking, delete_booking

# 

# Ask the agent for something out of scope.
results = agent("Ok now find me a good movie that I can watch tonight after our dinner.")
print(results)


# ## Analyzing Traces in Arize AI
# 
# After running the agent, you can view and analyze the traces in the Arize AI dashboard. The traces have been converted to OpenInference format by our custom processor, enabling rich visualization and analysis.
# 
# ### 1. Viewing Project Traces
# 
# First, navigate to your project in the Arize dashboard to see all the traces generated by your agent. Click on "Home" and Click on the strands-project you have defined in the notebook. You will be able to view your traces under the LLM tracing tab.
# 
# ![1. Project Traces](images/project_traces.png)
# 
# ### 2. Filtering Traces
# 
# Arize provides powerful filtering capabilities to help you find specific traces. You can filter by various attributes such as model ID, session ID, user ID, and more. For more information on filtering traces, see the [Arize documentation on filtering traces](https://arize.com/docs/ax/observe/tracing/how-to-query-traces/filter-traces).
# 
# ![2. Filter Traces](images/filter_traces.png)
# 
# ### 3. Filtering by Model ID
# 
# You can also filter by specific model IDs to analyze performance across different models:
# 
# ![3. Filter by Model ID](images/filter_trace_model_ID.png)
# 
# ### 4. Exploring Individual Traces
# 
# Click on a specific trace to see detailed information about the agent's execution:
# 
# ![4. Trace Details](images/trace_arize.png)
# 
# ### 5. Filtering and Analyzing Trace Information
# 
# You can filter and analyze trace information to focus on specific aspects of your agent's behavior:
# 
# ![5. Filter Trace Info](images/filter_trace_info.png)
# 
# ### 6. Visualizing the Agent's Execution Graph
# 
# The graph view shows the hierarchical structure of your agent's execution:
# 
# ![6. Graph View](images/graph.png)
# 
# ### 7. Inspecting Execution Paths
# 
# You can inspect specific execution paths to understand how your agent made decisions by clicking on the graph:
# 
# ![7. Inspect Path](images/inspect_path.png)
# 
# ### 8. Viewing Session Information
# 
# You can also view information about user sessions to understand patterns across multiple interactions under the Sessions tab next to LLM Tracing:
# 
# A [session](https://arize.com/docs/ax/observe/sessions-and-users) is a grouping of traces based on a session ID attribute. By adding session.id and user.id as attributes to spans, you can:
# 
# Find exactly where a conversation "breaks" or goes off the rails. This can help identify if a user becomes progressively more frustrated or if a chatbot is not helpful.
# 
# Find groups of traces where your application is not performing well. Adding session.id and/or user.id from an application enables back-and-forth interactions to be grouped and filtered further.
# 
# Construct custom metrics based on evals using session.id or user.id to find best/worst performing sessions and users
# 
# ![8. View Sessions](images/view_sessions.png)

# ## Setting Up Monitoring in Arize AI
# 
# Once you have your agent running, you'll want to set up monitoring to track its performance over time. Arize AI provides pre-built monitors that can help you detect issues early and ensure your agent is performing as expected.
# 
# ### 9. Pre-built Monitors
# 
# Arize offers several pre-built monitors that you can enable with a single click. These monitors track key metrics like latency, token usage, and error rates. To access these monitors, navigate to the "Monitors" tab in your project.
# 
# ![9. Pre-built Monitors](images/prebuilt_monitors.png)
# 
# ### 10. Monitor Explanation
# 
# Each monitor provides detailed information about what it tracks and how it can help you identify issues. For example, the "Latency" monitor tracks the response time of your agent and alerts you if it exceeds a certain threshold.
# 
# ![10. Monitor Explained](images/monitor_explained.png)
# 
# ### Benefits of Monitoring
# 
# Setting up monitors in Arize AI provides several benefits:
# 
# 1. **Early Issue Detection**: Identify problems before they impact users
# 2. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor key metrics over time to ensure consistent performance
# 3. **Cost Management**: Track token usage to optimize costs
# 4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure your agent is providing high-quality responses
# 
# For more information on setting up and using monitors, see the [Arize documentation on monitoring](https://arize.com/docs/ax/observe/production-monitoring).

# ## Key Metrics to Monitor
# 
# When monitoring your Strands agent in production, pay attention to these key metrics:
# 
# 1. **Latency**: How long it takes for your agent to respond to user queries
# 2. **Token Usage**: The number of tokens consumed by your agent, which affects costs
# 3. **Error Rate**: The percentage of requests that result in errors
# 4. **Tool Usage**: How often each tool is used and whether it's successful
# 5. **User Satisfaction**: Metrics that indicate user satisfaction, such as conversation length
# 
# By monitoring these metrics, you can ensure your agent is performing well and identify areas for improvement.

# ## Cleanup Resources
# 
# When you're done experimenting, you can clean up the AWS resources created for this notebook by running the cleanup script:

# In[ ]:


get_ipython().system('sh cleanup.sh')
